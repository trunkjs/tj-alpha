# Scope Module

## Overview

The `scope.ts` file defines the `Scope<T>` type and the `tj_scope<T>` function, which allows for managing scoped states with dynamic property access, lifecycle event handling, element referencing, and reactive data watching.

## Type Definition: `Scope<T>`

The `Scope<T>` type extends a base object (`T`) and provides additional functionalities:

- `$fn`: A collection of dynamically accessible functions.
- `$on`: Lifecycle event hooks, including:
  - `init`
  - `mounted`
  - `updated`
  - `destroyed`
- `$refs`: A map of referenced DOM elements.
- `$elements`: Functions triggered when an element with a reference (`ka:ref`) is rendered or updated.
- `$watch`: Reactive data watchers tracking changes in specific properties.

## Function: `tj_scope<T>`

The `tj_scope<T>` function creates a scoped state object wrapped in a `Proxy`, improving property resolution and event handling.

### Features:
- Ensures proper retrieval of core scope values.
- Dynamically accesses and invokes functions defined in `$fn`.
- Stores and retrieves DOM element references via `$refs`.
- Triggers `$watch` handlers when specified properties change, ensuring reactive behavior.
- Protects against runtime errors by validating property existence before access.
- Fixes syntax errors, ensuring `Proxy` behavior is correct and handles missing closing brackets properly.
- Enhances type inference for proper `IntelliSense` support when accessing scope properties.

## Example Usage

Below is an example of using `tj_scope` to manage a scoped object's state:

```typescript
let scope = tj_scope({
    form: null as string | null,

    $fn: {
        submitForm: () => {
            console.log("Form submitted:", scope.form);
        }
    },

    $refs: {},

    $watch: {
        'form': (event, value: string | null, oldValue, element, e) => {
            console.log('Form updated:', value);
        }
    }
});
```

### Explanation:
- `form` initializes as `null`.
- `$fn.submitForm` defines a method that logs the form submission.
- `$watch` listens for `form` property changes and logs updates.

## Edge Cases Handled

The module is designed to handle several edge cases, including:

- Accessing undefined properties does not throw errors but returns `undefined`.
- Ensures `$fn`, `$refs`, and `$watch` properties are properly managed to prevent runtime issues.
- Correctly handles reactive updates and function execution within `$watch`.
- Handles missing references in `$refs` gracefully.

## Purpose

This module provides a structured method for handling state, events, and element interactions in modern applications. It ensures reactivity, reduces error-prone code, and improves overall maintainability.
